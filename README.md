## Instead Intro


** EAFall ** - the name originates from the 
[Enter Shikari's] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXKPYXIlv54) song, and
was finally established during the events of the 14th when the world's 
attention was drawn to unprecedented action from one country to another.

The game's idea came up one summer day while playing WarCraft on an 
[Enfos] (https://www.epicwar.com/maps/188675/) map.
Obviously that a lot of things changed during development: landmark, balance, campaign,
control, etc. The cult saga 
[SpaceRangers] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Rangers_ (video_game))
made a significant impact.

If you have any fresh ideas or want to practice (programming), or change anything -
then I will be surprised, and I can advise you a bunch of other projects. 
If even these warnings wouldn't stop you, then ping me at yaroslavlancelot@gmail.com.

Anyone who finished the whole campaign can appear in the finishers list
[discoverers] (https://github.com/YaroslavHavrylovych/eafall/blob/develop/finishers_list.md).

## The Small Plot

History tells of a distant world of the future when humanity is displaced into distant planets.
At one time, the planets began fighting each other and destroyed almost half of the galaxy's population. 
In such a struggle, the Empire was born. Centralization, oppression
of the population, appearance standards - is just the beginning. Experiments over people,
groups of people, cities of people, planets of people. 
All riots were severely punished, each of their participants and all his family was cut to the root.

Oh, a little lyrical retreat of the consequences of human activity. 
Do you think people are beginning to colonize space "just because"? 
The Earth was abandoned, a pit.
The people who remained there survived continuous wars over resources, the famine. 
Naturally, this led to full-scale nuclear war. 
Only a few mutants that survived have remained on the ground ever since. 
Little we knew about their history until we've seen their ships in outer space — live ships.

And so, in this tumultuous mix of events, the first sprouts of uprisings began.
Mars.
Almost all Empire's soldiers on the planet have moved to the rebels' side. A small
group of representatives of the Empire was sent to discover the solution. In a couple of days,
when all the terms were clarified, and the next steps agreed, something unexpected began.
All the negotiators were declared beaten by Empire, and the rebels did not want to negotiate they said, 
and the planet must be destroyed for the sake of the galaxy's peace.

An ideal argument for starting a war between the Empire and Mars. Yes, one planet on
the measure of the universe. But it will be later. 
The first campaign is not about these events. It is about elder stories.

Year of 3014. People (or unpeople) on the Earth have found that galaxy's representatives will attack them.
The galaxy decided to clean the Earth from the radiation, from the mutants and to make it a zone of Empire's greatness. 
All it had to do was to slaughter a small cohort of aborigines.

##  Interesting coincidences

By the time this was written, I had forgotten almost everything I had planned. 
But there is something left on the shelves of memory:

- All dates are not coincidental.
- Each mission has the name of the old [Slavic god] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deities_of_Slavic_religion).
- EAFall has nothing to do with EAGames :).
- EAFall has something ideological about [Enter Shikari] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enter_Shikari).
- Planets other than Earth are known, at the time of writing, [exoplanets] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoplanet).
- All the stars are the sun under the names of [Greek] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helios) god, or [Japanese] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amaterasu) Goddess.

## Buildings 

Notes:
* Each building (which produces ships) generates oxygen in an amount which equals to 5% of building original price.
* Upgrade of the build would exclude previous price 
(e.g. first building 230, upgraded building 430 so upgrade price 430-230 = 200)

| Building | Produces | Cost | Effective against (by damage type) |
| -------- | -------- | ------------ | ---------------- |
| ![Water Cave][water_cave] | Lizard, Tortoise, Dragon | 270, 330, 430 | Buildings and group units (splash) |
| ![Invisible Plain][invisible_plain] |Scorpion, King Scorpion | 237, 350 | Massive attack |
| ![Hydra Pond][hydra_pond] | Young hydra, Hydra | 400, 445 | Water cave |
| ![Poison Cave][poison_cave] | Eel, Cobra | 335, 445 | Web, Hydra Pond |
| ![Web][web] | Spider1, Spider2 | 495, 535 | Mountain cave, Invisible Plain |
| ![Mountain Cave][mountain_cave] | Bat, Vampire | 585, 650 | Poison Cave, Hell |
| ![Hell][hell] | Agat, Kak | 665, 745 | Everyone but expensive |

## Special buildings

| Building | Cost | Special |
| -------- | ---- | ------- |
| ![Bastion][bastion] | 1200 | Creates 3 defence towers |
| ![Reptile City][reptile_city] | 500 | Firs increase income by 40%, each next by 5% |
| ![King of snakes][king_of_snakes] | 500 | Increase each unit attack power by 40% |

## Ships

There are more ships than buildings and you have to play to remember them.
