**EAFall** - android game project started in mid 2014 with an idea to bring WarCraft 3 
[enfos](https://www.epicwar.com/maps/188675/) map to mobile. As there were no day I could leave
without this game. As development started I changed a lot of things: started to create the
campaign, other game mechanics and finally switched from WarCraft setting to space (as idea from another
my favorite game [SpaceRangers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Rangers_(video_game))).
