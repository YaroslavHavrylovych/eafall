Home made project. Game which get it's root from WarCraft map.

Brief about game :
you have a planet as and your opponent. You can create some buildings on your planet. They are different in cost and produced units. Each unit have different armor and attack (not only value but type). YOU CAN'T CONTROL UNITS MOVEMENT ONLY BUILDINGS WHICH CREATES THEM.

It's still not finished so I can't describe it more cause I don't know what really will be in result. Rules and game objects sometimes changes with development so will see :)
