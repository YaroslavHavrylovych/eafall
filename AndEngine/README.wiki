=== AndEngine tribute ===
[[https://github.com/nicolasgramlich/AndEngine/tree/GLES2-AnchorCenter|AndEngine]](anchor-center) 
repository fork, as the main repository seems to be out of support.
Checkout [[https://github.com/nicolasgramlich/AndEngine/blob/GLES2/README.md|original readme]]
file to get more information.

=== Decision origins ===
I did that as couldn't find any supported AndEngine repo and I had founded and fixed
some out of the issues in the existing one. 

=== Just information ===
Official [[http://www.andengine.org/|WebSite]]

Still supported [[http://andengine-community.com/|community]]

Official [[https://github.com/nicolasgramlich/AndEngine/|github repo]].

=== Changes ===
I will try to write down all the //interesting//(not cosmetic) things I did/copied here: 

*Gradle
*Velocity camera
*SpriteBatch entity positioning
*ParallaxBackground changes in ParallaxEntity#onDraw(GLState, Camera,float) to work normally with ZoomCamera
*reset(float pDuration, float pFromX, float pFromY, float pToX, float pToY) added to MoveModifier
